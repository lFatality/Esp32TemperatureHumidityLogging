Logging Temperature & Humidity and logging it in a Google spreadsheet in the cloud
==================================================================================

Boards used:
* Adafruit Si7021
* ESP32 TTGO T8 v1.7.1

The code and the google script were adjusted but this is the general idea.

Good information about sensor (also check other subpages):
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-si7021-temperature-plus-humidity-sensor/overview

i2C pins on the esp:
* SDA = 21
* SCL = 22

Connect 5V of the ESP to the Vin of the Si7021.
The 3V pin is an output pin (up to 100mA).
